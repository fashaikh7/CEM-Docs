## FoxyProxy Troubleshooting

If host OS has Selinux enabled then FoxyProxy scoks connection will not work. Please disable selinux and any iptables rules to fix this issue.

```bash

sestatus

setenforce 0

To permanently disbale “selinux” set SELINUX=disable in “/etc/selinux/config”

# cat /etc/selinux/config

# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted

Note: Abobe file change will requried a reboot.

To disbale firewall rule use:

iptables -F

 ```
